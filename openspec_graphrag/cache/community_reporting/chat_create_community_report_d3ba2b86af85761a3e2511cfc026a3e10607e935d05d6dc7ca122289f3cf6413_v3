They play a critical role in the address translation process, ensuring that virtual memory addresses used by programs are correctly translated to corresponding physical memory addresses. Page Tables are commonly utilized in ARM systems and other architectures to facilitate efficient and secure memory access. By organizing memory mappings in a structured, hierarchical manner, Page Tables enable systems to manage memory effectively, support multitasking, and implement features such as virtual memory.
