In this format, the least significant bit (LSB) is assigned an index of zero, and indices increase with the significance of the bits. Additionally, the least significant byte is stored first in memory, followed by more significant bytes. This format is widely used in certain computing architectures for compatibility and efficiency [Data: Entities (44); Relationships (56)].\",\"summary\":\"LITTLE-ENDIAN format and its characteristics\"},{\"explanation\":\"The BIG-ENDIAN format is another data representation scheme, emphasizing the prioritization of the most significant elements. In this format, the most significant bit (MSB) is assigned an index of zero, and indices increase sequentially toward the least significant bit. The most significant byte is stored first in memory or transmitted first in a data stream. This format is commonly used in various computing architectures and network protocols [Data: Entities (45); Relationships (57)].\",\"summary\":\"BIG-ENDIAN format and its characteristics\"},{\"explanation\":\"The HL register is a 32-bit register divided into two fields: H (high half-word) and L (low half-word).
