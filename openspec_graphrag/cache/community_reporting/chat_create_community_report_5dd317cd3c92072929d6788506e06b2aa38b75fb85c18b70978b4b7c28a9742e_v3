It includes advanced features such as timeout handling and interrupt triggering, making it a versatile tool for managing time-sensitive operations. Additionally, TIMER_DEVICE serves as a simulated timer hardware used in testing scenarios and examples, demonstrating its functionality and reliability in controlled environments. This dual-purpose design highlights its role as both a practical hardware solution and a testing tool for timer-based applications. [Data: Entities (337)]\",\"summary\":\"TIMER_DEVICE is a versatile hardware timer implementation.\"},{\"explanation\":\"The TIMER_EVENT is an event object designed to manage timer-based actions with precision and reliability. It plays a critical role in the arming, cancellation, and handling of timers, ensuring proper management of timeout values within the timer bank. TIMER_EVENT is specifically triggered by the Timer Device when a timeout occurs. Upon activation, it clears the running bit and sets the timeout flag, signaling the completion of the timer's countdown. This event ensures that timer-based operations are executed efficiently, with mechanisms in place to handle both the posting of events and their cancellation as needed. [Data: Entities (338)]\",\"summary\":\"TIMER_EVENT manages timer-based actions with precision.\"},{\"explanation\":\"The Periodic Timer is an event that fires at regular intervals, rescheduling itself based on a defined period. This feature is implemented within the TIMER_DEVICE, enabling regular interval-based events. [Data: Entities (336); Relationships (488)]\",\"summary\":\"Periodic Timer enables regular interval-based events.\"},{\"explanation\":\"The Timestamp Counter (TSC) is a hardware register that increments with CPU cycles and is used for tracking simulation time and cycles. The TIMER_DEVICE uses the TSC for time tracking and conversion between simulation time and cycles.
