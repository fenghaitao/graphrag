It operates by requiring periodic refresh signals; if these signals are not received within a specified timeframe, the timer assumes the system is unresponsive and triggers a predefined action, such as a system reset or an interrupt. This mechanism ensures that the system can recover from software malfunctions, hangs, or other failures that might otherwise render it unresponsive [Data: Entities (326)].\",\"summary\":\"The Watchdog Timer enhances system reliability by monitoring activity and initiating corrective actions upon timeout.\"},{\"explanation\":\"Simics DML is a framework for modeling timing-related features and timer devices, providing mechanisms for scheduling callbacks, event handling, and timer counter modeling.
