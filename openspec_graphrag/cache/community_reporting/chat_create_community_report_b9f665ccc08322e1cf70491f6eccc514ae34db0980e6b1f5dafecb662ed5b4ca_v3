It ensures efficient and continuous data flow by organizing data in a First-In-First-Out manner. This method is also a key feature in I2C devices, enhancing data transfer efficiency through dedicated transmit and receive FIFOs. By leveraging this approach, FIFO Buffering minimizes latency, optimizes resource utilization, and supports seamless communication in systems requiring high-speed and reliable data handling [Data: Entities (577); Relationships (906)].\",\"summary\":\"FIFO Buffering is a critical technique for efficient data handling in DMA and I2C devices.\"},{\"explanation\":\"The I2C protocol is a general-purpose communication protocol widely used in embedded systems for connecting microcontrollers, sensors, and other peripherals.
