This capability significantly improves system efficiency by offloading data transfer tasks from the processor, allowing it to focus on other operations. DMA is commonly utilized by peripherals such as UARTs and other devices that require high-speed data transfer. The term \\\"DMA\\\" also refers to a category of Direct Memory Access devices, which includes specific models such as the \\\"synopsys-ahb-dmac\\\" and \\\"sample-dma-device.\\\" These devices are designed to implement DMA functionality, facilitating seamless and efficient data movement within a system. By leveraging DMA, systems can achieve faster data processing and reduced CPU overhead, making it an essential feature in modern computing and embedded systems.
