It is a feature of the PCIe (Peripheral Component Interconnect Express) standard that replaces traditional legacy interrupts with PCIe messages. This approach allows for the conversion of legacy interrupts into modern message-based signals, facilitating improved performance and scalability. MSI supports up to 32 independent interrupt vectors, which are automatically translated, enhancing the efficiency of interrupt handling in complex hardware environments. This technology is widely utilized in modern computing systems to streamline communication between devices and the processor, reducing latency and improving overall system performance.
