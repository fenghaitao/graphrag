I will carefully review the text again and ensure that all relevant entities and relationships matching the specified types (organization, person, geo, event) are extracted. Here is the updated and expanded extraction:\n\n---\n\n(\"entity\"<|>IRQ<|>EVENT<|>An interrupt request (IRQ) is a signal sent to the processor to gain its attention for handling specific tasks, such as updating or triggering combined interrupt lines.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DMA_CONTROL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>DMA_control is a register responsible for managing Direct Memory Access (DMA) operations, including interrupt enabling, transfer completion, and error handling.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INTR_TARGET<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Intr_target is the signal interface used for generating and managing DMA interrupts towards the CPU.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SG_LIST_HEAD_T<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Sg_list_head_t is a data structure that serves as the header for scatter-gather lists, pointing to the first block of data for DMA transfers.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SG_LIST_BLOCK_ROW_T<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Sg_list_block_row_t is a data structure representing individual entries in a scatter-gather list, which can be either data blocks or extension blocks.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LOOP_DETECTION<|>EVENT<|>Loop detection is a mechanism implemented using the tortoise and hare algorithm to identify circular references in scatter-gather lists during DMA operations.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DMA_INTERRUPT_POSTED<|>EVENT<|>DMA_interrupt_posted is an event that tracks whether an interrupt has been raised during a DMA operation, ensuring proper clearing logic is applied.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TRANSFER_COMPLETE<|>EVENT<|>Transfer complete is an event signaled by setting the TC bit in the DMA_control register, indicating that a DMA operation has successfully finished.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ERROR_STATE<|>EVENT<|>Error state is an event triggered when the DMA_control register detects an issue, such as a loop in the scatter-gather list, halting the operation.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SIGNAL_INTERFACE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Signal interface is the communication mechanism used by intr_target to raise or lower interrupt signals during DMA operations.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SCATTER_GATHER_TRANSFER<|>EVENT<|>Scatter-gather transfer is a DMA operation that uses linked lists of memory blocks to efficiently transfer data between devices.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TORTOISE_AND_HARE_ALGORITHM<|>EVENT<|>The tortoise and hare algorithm is used to detect loops in scatter-gather lists during DMA operations, ensuring data integrity and preventing infinite loops.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WRITE_TO_CLEAR<|>EVENT<|>Write-to-clear is an event where writing a specific value (e.g., 0) to a register clears an interrupt or status flag, ensuring proper synchronization.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>IRQ<|>DMA_CONTROL<|>IRQ signals are managed and triggered based on the state of the DMA_control register, which determines whether interrupts are enabled and tracks their status.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DMA_CONTROL<|>INTR_TARGET<|>DMA_control interacts with intr_target to raise or lower interrupt signals towards the CPU based on the state of DMA operations.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SG_LIST_HEAD_T<|>SG_LIST_BLOCK_ROW_T<|>Sg_list_head_t points to the first sg_list_block_row_t entry, which represents the data or extension blocks in a scatter-gather list.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DMA_CONTROL<|>LOOP_DETECTION<|>DMA_control monitors the scatter-gather transfer process, and loop detection is used to prevent errors caused by circular references in the list.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SG_LIST_BLOCK_ROW_T<|>LOOP_DETECTION<|>Sg_list_block_row_t entries are checked for loops using the loop detection mechanism to ensure the integrity of scatter-gather transfers.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DMA_INTERRUPT_POSTED<|>TRANSFER_COMPLETE<|>DMA_interrupt_posted tracks whether an interrupt was raised when a transfer is marked as complete by setting the TC bit.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TRANSFER_COMPLETE<|>DMA_CONTROL<|>The transfer complete event is signaled by the DMA_control register, which sets the TC bit to indicate the end of a DMA operation.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ERROR_STATE<|>DMA_CONTROL<|>The error state is triggered by the DMA_control register when an issue, such as a loop in the scatter-gather list, is detected.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SCATTER_GATHER_TRANSFER<|>SG_LIST_HEAD_T<|>Scatter-gather transfers begin with the sg_list_head_t structure, which points to the first block of data in the list.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SCATTER_GATHER_TRANSFER<|>SG_LIST_BLOCK_ROW_T<|>Scatter-gather transfers rely on sg_list_block_row_t entries to define the memory blocks to be transferred.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SCATTER_GATHER_TRANSFER<|>TORTOISE_AND_HARE_ALGORITHM<|>Scatter-gather transfers use the tortoise and hare algorithm to detect and prevent loops in the memory block list.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WRITE_TO_CLEAR<|>DMA_CONTROL<|>The write-to-clear mechanism is implemented in the DMA_control register to clear interrupt or status flags by writing specific values.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SIGNAL_INTERFACE<|>INTR_TARGET<|>The signal interface is used by intr_target to manage the raising and lowering of interrupt signals during DMA
