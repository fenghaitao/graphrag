I will now carefully review the text again and extract all relevant entities and relationships that match the specified types: **organization, person, geo, event**. Here is the updated and expanded extraction:\n\n---\n\n(\"entity\"<|>INTERRUPT CONTROLLER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Interrupt Controller is a device model in the DML 1.4 category, designed to manage software and timer interrupts for RISC-V processors. It supports up to 64 hardware threads (HARTs) and includes features like signal connections, state tracking, and event-based timer interrupt handling.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RISC-V<|>ORGANIZATION<|>RISC-V is an open standard instruction set architecture (ISA) that the Core-Level Interrupt Controller is designed to support, providing software and timer interrupts for its processors.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RISCV-CLINT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The RISC-V Core-Level Interrupt Controller (CLINT) is a device model that provides software and timer interrupts for RISC-V processors. It includes features like signal connections, state tracking, and timer overflow limitations.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DML 1.4<|>EVENT<|>DML 1.4 is the version of the Device Modeling Language used to describe and implement the Interrupt Controller device models, including the RISC-V CLINT.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HART<|>ORGANIZATION<|>HART (Hardware Thread) refers to the individual processing threads supported by the RISC-V Core-Level Interrupt Controller, with a maximum of 64 threads supported.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MSIP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>MSIP (Machine Software Interrupt Pending) is a signal interface provided by the RISC-V CLINT for managing software interrupts, with one signal per hardware thread.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MTIP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>MTIP (Machine Timer Interrupt Pending) is a signal interface provided by the RISC-V CLINT for managing timer interrupts, with one signal per hardware thread.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CLOCK_DISABLE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CLOCK_DISABLE is a signal port in the RISC-V CLINT that halts the advancement of the timer and prevents new timer interrupts when activated.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TIMER INTERRUPT<|>EVENT<|>Timer Interrupt is an event triggered by the RISC-V CLINT when the timer reaches a specified compare value, managed through the mtime and mtimecmp registers.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SOFTWARE INTERRUPT<|>EVENT<|>Software Interrupt is an event triggered by the RISC-V CLINT through the MSIP register, allowing software to signal interrupts to the processor.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MTIME<|>ORGANIZATION<|>MTIME is a timer register in the RISC-V CLINT that tracks the current time and is used to trigger timer interrupts when compared with mtimecmp.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MTIMECMP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>MTIMECMP is a compare register in the RISC-V CLINT that holds the value against which the mtime register is compared to trigger timer interrupts.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SIMPLE_TIME_EVENT<|>EVENT<|>Simple Time Event is an event-based mechanism used in the RISC-V CLINT to schedule and manage timer interrupts based on the mtime and mtimecmp registers.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SIGNAL CONNECTION<|>EVENT<|>Signal Connection is an event in the RISC-V CLINT that allows the interrupt controller to raise or lower interrupts to CPUs through MSIP and MTIP signals.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HARD RESET<|>EVENT<|>Hard Reset is an event in the RISC-V CLINT that clears all interrupt signals and resets the state of the MSIP and MTIP registers.)\n\n---\n\n(\"relationship\"<|>INTERRUPT CONTROLLER<|>RISC-V<|>The Interrupt Controller is designed to manage interrupts for
