It encompasses two related concepts: bit numbering and byte ordering. In terms of bit numbering, BIG-ENDIAN is a scheme where the most significant bit (MSB) is assigned the index zero, and the indices increase sequentially toward the least significant bit (LSB), which has the highest index. This approach ensures that the bit with the greatest value significance is positioned first in the numbering sequence.\n\nIn the context of byte ordering, BIG-ENDIAN describes a format where the most significant byte (MSB) is stored first in memory or transmitted first in a data stream. This ordering is commonly used in endian integer types and data layouts, ensuring that the byte with the highest value significance appears at the lowest memory address or is processed first. This format is widely employed in various computing architectures and network protocols to maintain consistency in data interpretation across systems.\n\nIn summary, BIG-ENDIAN defines both a bit numbering scheme and a byte order format, emphasizing the prioritization of the most significant elements in data representation.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 216, "prompt_tokens": 190, "total_tokens": 406, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": null, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}, "prompt_index": 0}]}}}
