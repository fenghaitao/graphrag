It plays a critical role in managing the execution flow by introducing precise delays, ensuring that operations occur at the intended time within a simulation environment. Beyond its specific application in Simics DML, the \"after\" statement is also a general programming construct used to delay method calls until specific conditions are met. This functionality is essential for maintaining proper execution order and preventing bugs in asynchronous systems, where tasks may otherwise execute out of sequence. By combining timing control with condition-based execution, the \"after\" statement ensures robust and predictable behavior in both simulation and broader programming contexts.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 140, "prompt_tokens": 201, "total_tokens": 341, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": null, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}, "prompt_index": 0}]}}}
