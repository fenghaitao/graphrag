It includes advanced features such as timeout handling and interrupt triggering, making it a versatile tool for managing time-sensitive operations. Additionally, TIMER_DEVICE serves as a simulated timer hardware used in testing scenarios and examples, demonstrating its functionality and reliability in controlled environments. This dual-purpose design highlights its role as both a practical hardware solution and a testing tool for timer-based applications.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 90, "prompt_tokens": 180, "total_tokens": 270, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": null, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}, "prompt_index": 0}]}}}
