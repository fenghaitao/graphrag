It is used for managing time-related operations in simulations, including countdown timers, watchdog timers, and event scheduling. As a general category of devices, the Timer Device encompasses specific implementations such as the Nios V Timer and the Sample Timer Device, which are tailored for different simulation needs. These devices play a critical role in ensuring accurate and efficient time management within simulated environments, making them essential tools for developers working on complex systems.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 112, "prompt_tokens": 200, "total_tokens": 312, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": null, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}, "prompt_index": 0}]}}}
