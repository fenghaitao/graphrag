It plays a critical role in the arming, cancellation, and handling of timers, ensuring proper management of timeout values within the timer bank. TIMER_EVENT is specifically triggered by the Timer Device when a timeout occurs. Upon activation, it clears the running bit and sets the timeout flag, signaling the completion of the timer's countdown. This event ensures that timer-based operations are executed efficiently, with mechanisms in place to handle both the posting of events and their cancellation as needed.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 115, "prompt_tokens": 210, "total_tokens": 325, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": null, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}, "prompt_index": 0}]}}}
