It is responsible for performing virtual-to-physical address translation, a process that allows programs to use virtual memory addresses while the MMU maps these to physical memory locations. This functionality enables efficient memory utilization and simplifies programming by abstracting the complexities of physical memory management. Additionally, the MMU provides memory protection, ensuring that different processes running on a system are isolated from one another, thereby preventing unauthorized access or interference between them. As a category of devices, MMUs are essential for maintaining system stability, security, and performance in modern computing environments.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 126, "prompt_tokens": 192, "total_tokens": 318, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": null, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}, "prompt_index": 0}]}}}
