It is used to emulate and analyze the behavior of interrupt raise and lower events in device interactions, making it a valuable tool for debugging and validating system functionality. FAKEPIC includes attributes such as \"raised,\" which tracks the state of interrupts, allowing developers to monitor and evaluate how interrupts are managed during testing scenarios. By simulating the functionality of an interrupt controller, FAKEPIC plays a critical role in timing tests and ensures that systems respond appropriately to interrupt signals. This makes it an essential component in environments where accurate and reliable interrupt handling is crucial.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 125, "prompt_tokens": 217, "total_tokens": 342, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": null, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}, "prompt_index": 0}]}}}
