These devices support key features such as bus arbitration, which ensures orderly communication between multiple devices on the same bus; addressing, which allows devices to be uniquely identified and targeted for data exchange; and data transfer mechanisms that enable efficient communication. Additionally, I2C devices often incorporate FIFO (First-In, First-Out) buffering to manage data flow and improve performance. By implementing the I2C protocol, these devices play a critical role in enabling reliable and efficient communication in a wide range of electronic applications.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 131, "prompt_tokens": 201, "total_tokens": 332, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": null, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}, "prompt_index": 0}]}}}
