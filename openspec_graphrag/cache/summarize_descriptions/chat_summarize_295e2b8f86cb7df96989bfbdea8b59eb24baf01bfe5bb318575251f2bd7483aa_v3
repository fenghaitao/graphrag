It incorporates a range of features aimed at improving functionality, efficiency, and compatibility. Key features of I3C include dynamic address assignment, which allows devices to be assigned unique addresses during operation, and private read/write transfers, enabling secure and efficient data exchange. The protocol also supports in-band interrupt functionality, allowing devices to signal events without requiring additional wires, and packet error checking, which ensures data integrity during communication.\n\nI3C is backward compatible with the widely used I2C protocol, making it easier to integrate into existing systems while offering enhanced capabilities. Additionally, the protocol includes robust error handling mechanisms to ensure reliable communication between devices. Overall, I3C is a modern and versatile communication standard designed to meet the needs of advanced device ecosystems.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 178, "prompt_tokens": 213, "total_tokens": 391, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": null, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}, "prompt_index": 0}]}}}
