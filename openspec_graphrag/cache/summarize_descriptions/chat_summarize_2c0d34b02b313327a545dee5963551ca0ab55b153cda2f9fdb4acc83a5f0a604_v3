In the context of DML (Device Modeling Language), registers are composed of fields that define the smallest data units, with each field corresponding to a specific bit range. These fields serve as subcomponents of registers, each with distinct meanings or behaviors, and are used to define specific attributes or functionalities within the register.\n\nFields, such as INTEN and RESEN, are examples of these subcomponents and are part of specific registers, like WDOGCONTROL. These fields represent particular bits or bit ranges and play a critical role in defining the behavior and attributes of the register they belong to. Together, registers and their fields form a structured way to manage and interpret data at the bit level, enabling precise control and functionality in various applications.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 166, "prompt_tokens": 243, "total_tokens": 409, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": null, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}, "prompt_index": 0}]}}}
