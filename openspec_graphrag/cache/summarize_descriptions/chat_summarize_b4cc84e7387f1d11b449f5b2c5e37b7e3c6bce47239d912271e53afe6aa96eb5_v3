It is a C-like language tailored for transaction-level modeling (TLM) rather than register-transfer level (RTL), making it particularly suited for high-level hardware simulation and testing workflows. DML is used to define the behavior, attributes, and interfaces of simulated devices, including device banks, registers, fields, and their associated behaviors. It supports the creation of complex device models, such as PCIe devices, and includes features like templates, parameterized configurations, and DMA register configurations.\n\nThe language provides a structured module system for importing and managing source files, as well as a syntax for pragmas, which serve as directives to the DML compiler. DML supports advanced programming constructs such as method calls, exception handling, template-qualified method implementation calls, and compile-time tests. It also includes features for size calculations, iteration, list handling, and bit slicing, enabling developers to define intricate device behaviors and configurations.\n\nDML is integral to the Simics platform, where it is used to define and implement device models, including their behavior, attributes, and connections. It allows developers to specify device interfaces and methods that simulated objects must match, ensuring accurate and consistent modeling. The language is particularly effective for defining transaction-level device models, focusing on high-level interactions rather than low-level hardware details.\n\nIn addition to its role in defining device models, DML includes specific rules and syntax for assignments, type declarations, and exception handling, making it a robust and versatile tool for hardware simulation. Its capabilities extend to defining register banks, registers, fields, and their behaviors, which are critical for Simics testing workflows. By enabling the creation of detailed and accurate device models, DML plays a key role in the development and simulation of hardware systems within the Simics environment.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 380, "prompt_tokens": 819, "total_tokens": 1199, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": null, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}, "prompt_index": 0}]}}}
