In the DML (Device Modeling Language), a bank is a sub-object that represents a memory-mapped register interface, containing registers and fields that define hardware specifications. It serves as a grouping mechanism for registers in DML code, enabling the organization and management of hardware resources in a logical and efficient manner.\n\nIn Simics, a bank is understood as a memory-mapped region of a device, often containing registers or other data structures. This aligns with its role as a logical grouping of registers or objects, which helps to structure and organize hardware components within a device model. Additionally, a bank is a type of object declaration used in documentation to group registers and other related objects, further emphasizing its role as a structural element.\n\nOverall, a bank is a versatile and essential construct that facilitates the logical organization, management, and representation of hardware resources, whether in DML code, Simics simulations, or related documentation.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 205, "prompt_tokens": 246, "total_tokens": 451, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": null, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}, "prompt_index": 0}]}}}
