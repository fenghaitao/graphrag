It serves as a blueprint for creating objects or groups with predefined properties and methods, enabling efficient reuse and consistency across implementations. Templates can be instantiated in multiple locations within a document or codebase, allowing developers to apply the same structure or behavior without redundancy.\n\nIn the context of programming, a template is a reusable structure or method definition that facilitates the inheritance of shared behaviors or properties by object declarations. This makes it a powerful tool for defining common functionality across multiple objects or functions. Templates are particularly useful for creating modular and maintainable code, as they allow developers to define reusable pieces of code that can be instantiated and customized as needed.\n\nIn Device Modeling Language (DML), templates are constructs that enable the definition of reusable method implementations and the resolution of conflicts in method overrides. They are applied to registers or fields within a device model, controlling their read and write operations. This ensures consistency and simplifies the management of device behavior by encapsulating predefined or custom behaviors in a reusable format.\n\nOverall, templates are essential tools for promoting code reuse, reducing redundancy, and maintaining consistency in both programming and modeling contexts. They provide a flexible and efficient way to define and apply shared structures, behaviors, and configurations across various applications.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 267, "prompt_tokens": 288, "total_tokens": 555, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": null, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}, "prompt_index": 0}]}}}
