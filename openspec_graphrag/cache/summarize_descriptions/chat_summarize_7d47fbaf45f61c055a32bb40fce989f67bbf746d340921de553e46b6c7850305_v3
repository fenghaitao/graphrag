They serve as reusable code structures that allow for efficient handling of repetitive or parameterized elements within device modeling and simulation. By leveraging template instantiation, parameterization, and specialization, templates provide a flexible framework for defining and reusing structures, behaviors, and methods.\n\nTemplates are particularly useful for defining parameters and methods that can be applied across multiple device models, ensuring consistency and reducing redundancy in the codebase. These reusable structures can be instantiated to create specific implementations and overridden to customize behaviors as needed, making them highly adaptable to various simulation scenarios.\n\nIn summary, templates in DML are essential tools for defining reusable, parameterized, and specialized structures that enhance the efficiency and flexibility of device modeling and simulation.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 166, "prompt_tokens": 226, "total_tokens": 392, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": null, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}, "prompt_index": 0}]}}}
