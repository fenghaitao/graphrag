It facilitates the transmission and reception of data between devices by converting parallel data from a computer or microcontroller into serial form for transmission and vice versa for reception. UART devices are equipped with features such as FIFO (First In, First Out) buffering, which helps manage data flow efficiently, and error detection mechanisms to ensure reliable communication. As a category of hardware communication peripherals, UARTs are widely utilized in embedded systems and other electronic applications to enable asynchronous data exchange without requiring a shared clock signal between the communicating devices.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 125, "prompt_tokens": 197, "total_tokens": 322, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": null, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}, "prompt_index": 0}]}}}
