It builds on the foundational structure of C, extending its type system with additional features that provide greater flexibility and functionality. DML incorporates deviations from standard C to introduce these enhancements, making it a specialized tool for certain applications.\n\nOne of DML's notable features is its ability to integrate seamlessly with C. For instance, it ensures compatibility by exposing union data types as structs, allowing for smoother interoperability between the two languages. This design choice enables developers to leverage DML's advanced features while still working within the familiar framework of C.\n\nIn summary, DML is a language that extends and modifies C, offering a richer type system and additional capabilities while maintaining mechanisms for integration and compatibility with its parent language.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 173, "prompt_tokens": 215, "total_tokens": 388, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": null, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}, "prompt_index": 0}]}}}
