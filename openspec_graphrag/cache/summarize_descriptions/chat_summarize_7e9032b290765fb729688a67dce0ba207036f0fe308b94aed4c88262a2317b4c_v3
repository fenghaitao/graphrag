This process is particularly valuable for high-speed data transfers, as it reduces the need for CPU intervention, thereby improving overall system performance. DMA is widely utilized in scenarios where large volumes of data need to be moved quickly and efficiently between memory and hardware devices. Comprehensive examples and patterns related to DMA can be found in the DML (Direct Memory Access Library) documentation, which provides detailed guidance on its implementation and usage.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 111, "prompt_tokens": 196, "total_tokens": 307, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": null, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"content_filter_results": {}, "prompt_index": 0}]}}}
