It facilitates efficient data transfer between devices and supports dual-mode operation and state management. I2C is widely used in a variety of devices, including controllers and targets, and is implemented with diverse features to suit different applications. Despite being considered a legacy protocol, I2C remains relevant due to its simplicity and effectiveness in enabling communication between components. Furthermore, it is supported by the more advanced I3C protocol for backward compatibility, ensuring continued integration with systems that rely on I2C.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 118, "prompt_tokens": 215, "total_tokens": 333, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": null, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}, "prompt_index": 0}]}}}
