This process can be executed in different modes, including contiguous mode, where data is transferred in a sequential block, and scatter-gather mode, which allows for non-contiguous data transfers by breaking the data into smaller chunks and reassembling them as needed. DMA TRANSFER is a highly efficient method for moving data, as it bypasses the need for the CPU to manage the transfer directly, thereby freeing up CPU resources for other tasks. This capability makes DMA TRANSFER an essential feature in systems requiring high-speed data movement and optimized performance.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 131, "prompt_tokens": 180, "total_tokens": 311, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": null, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}, "prompt_index": 0}]}}}
